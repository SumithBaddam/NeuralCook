# NeuralCook

Deep learning application to identify ingredients from cooking dishes images and recommend dishes to cook, given a set of ingredients. This application leverages NLP and Computer Vision to learn semantic knowledge using joint embeddings.

Parsing an image of a dish and identifying its ingredients is not a complex task for humans. Indeed, people can quickly identify the dish and its ingredients just by looking at it. But it is much more complex for computers. To produce systems that can achieve this, we combine current state-of-the-art techniques in both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to learn the semantic knowledge from both images and recipes using joint embeddings.
